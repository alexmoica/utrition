	This document depicts the Verification and Validation Plan for the Utrition project. This includes verifying both implementation and documentation. The document will depict the plans for reviewing all critical documentation along with the system and unit tests to be used for code verification.  \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
		Verification and Validation plan}
	
	\section{General Information}
	
	\subsection{Summary}
	
	\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview 
	of
		its general functions.}
		The purpose behind this document is to provide the testing plan that Utrition will undergo during its development period. This plan will ensure a high quality final product. Utrition is an application that allows individuals to discover the nutritional value of the foods they are consuming and track their previously eaten meals. This software consists of three main functions that are being tested such as image processing and identification, displaying an interface for the user, and writing to a database. (COME BACK TO THESE FUNCTIONS)
	
	\subsection{Objectives} (REDO)
	
	\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be 
	around
		the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
		something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
		``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the 
		qualities,
		just those that are most important.}
		
		The objectives behind the design of the testing plan for Utrition is to design to code to fit various qualities to ensure the effectiveness of the final product. Firstly, the developers of Utrition would like to ensure the correctness of this application as this is a health based application. We want to ensure that the artificial intelligence can correctly identify the food that is in the image and therefore output the correct nutritional information. Additionally the Utrition application is expected to be robust and to be able to deal with very common errors that may potentially occur such as a user uploading an image of the wrong type. All tests written in this document are written to ensure that the code meets these objectives standards. 

- build confidence in image identification AI
- Ensure nutrition facts are correct
- Prevent crashing of the system with unusual inputs
	
	\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
	
	\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your 
	SRS
		and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, 
		etc).  You
		can include these even before they are written, since by the time the 
		project
		is done, they will be written.}

		This document references multiple other documents that are listed below:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item SRS, \citet{SRS}
			\item Development Plan, \citet{DevelopmentPlan}
			\item MG, \citet{MG}
			\item MIS, \citet{MIS}
		\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Plan}
	
	\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
		come.}
	This section details Durum Wheat Semolina's approaches for verifying and validating Utrition's documentation and implementation. Specific documentation to be reviewed are the SRS, Design documents (MG and MIS), and VnV Plan. Additionally, the verification and validation of Utrition's implementation is discussed. Tools being used for verification including automated testing frameworks and linters are also detailed below.
	
	\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}
	
	\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
		You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's 
		role is
		for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize 
		this information.}
	
	Each team member will be contributing to the verification and validation of Utrition's supporting documentation and implementation. Jack Theriault is the team's testing lead and can be deferred to for any queries regarding verification procedures. It is expected that all team members create the tests that correspond to their written code. In addition, each team member's specific role in the verification and validation process is given below.

	\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
	
	\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may 
	include
		ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan 
		for 
		something more rigorous/systematic.}
	
	\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}
	
	To verify Utrition's SRS document, two approaches will be primarily used. Firstly, ad hoc reviews by fellow classmates are done to provide Durum Wheat Semolina with feedback from an outsider perspective. The rubric for the SRS is heavily used during this process. \\
	
	Once feedback from these reviews has been collected in addition to the feedback given by SFWRENG 4G06 TAs while marking version 0, the team will walk through the SRS and make any necessary changes. Since the SRS is critical when implementing Utrition, this review process will be done by all team members to ensure total coverage of possible improvements. The team will be instructed to go through all functional and non-functional requirements to identify any ambiguities or missing requirements. Once identified, the corresponding changes will be made. This walkthrough will be led by Justina Srebrnjak who is in charge of SRS verification.

	\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
	
	\wss{Plans for design verification}
	
	\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}
	
	\wss{Create a checklists?}
	
	Utrition's design documents will be verified through a combination of peer reviews and documentation walkthroughs. Once version 0 of the design documents has been completed, students from SFWRENG 4G06 will perform ad hoc reviews based on the criteria given in the design rubric. These critiques will make Durum Wheat Semolina aware of any discrepancies found in the documentation.\\
	
	Secondly, documentation walkthroughs will be conducted by all team members to verify the completeness of the design documents. The primary purpose of these walkthroughs is to verify that all functional requirements listed in the SRS document are fulfilled through the proposed design. Any missing functionality will be identified through this process and amended as needed. This verification plan will be led by Catherine Chen.
	
	\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}
	
	\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also 
	be verified.}
	
	\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}
	
	\wss{Create a checklists?}
	
	The verification plan for the VnV plan document will consist of two techniques. Firstly, ad hoc reviews from the team's classmates in SFWRENG 4G06 will be conducted. These reviews will identify any discrepancies indicated by the VnV plan rubric. Their resulting feedback will contribute to any changes made to the document.\\
	
	In addition to peer reviews, the Utrition team will participate in a walkthrough of the document while referring to the SRS. During this review, the team will verify that every requirement found in the SRS has at least one test that will test its completeness. This review will be led by Jack Theriault. 
	
	\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
	
	\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the 
	unit
		testing plan.}
	
	\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for 
	static verification of
		the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, 
		code
		inspection, static analyzers, etc.}
	
	Verifying Utrition's implementation will be done through a variety of dynamic and static verification techniques. In terms of dynamic methods, a variety of system and unit tests will be performed on the written code. More information on these tests can be found in sections 5 and 6 of this document. These tests will be created by the entire team. More specifically, the people who work on a certain functionality of Utrition will be responsible for creating the corresponding test cases. These tests will be automated and run on the system whenever new code is pushed to the team's main branch on GitHub. This ensures that new code does not create any regressions in the current system. Alexander Moica will be the dynamic verification lead which entails monitoring new test case additions and ensuring full testing coverage of new code which includes edge cases and error cases.\\

	Static verification will be done primarily through coding standards and code inspections. When writing code, each team member will be responsible for abiding by the coding guidelines outlined in Utrition's \href{https://github.com/jeff-rey-wang/utrition/blob/dff32f8ddc662d07db9bd74e0b3705aa657dae6e/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan} in section 7. Python development will use the linter Pylint to enforce PEP8 standards. The Google style guides for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS will need to be followed manually. Additionally, coding inspections will be done for every new PR that is made to the team's main branch in GitHub. Before any PR is merged, at least one team member will be required to review the incoming code. During these reviews, team members will ensure complete functionality fulfillment inline with documentation, proper coding style, efficient implementation choices, and consistent naming practices for files, functions, and variables. Jeffrey Wang will lead this static verification plan to ensure all coding inspections are completed and answer any questions regarding static verification.
	
	\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
	
	\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
		framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible 
		tools
		include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test 
		coverage
		tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
		Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming 
		language
		you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also 
		be tools
		that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
		Python.}
	
	\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
		that document.}
	
	\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
		implementation.}
	
	The tools used for automated testing and verification have been previously outlined in the \href{https://github.com/jeff-rey-wang/utrition/blob/dff32f8ddc662d07db9bd74e0b3705aa657dae6e/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan} for Utrition in sections 6 and 7. 
	
	\subsection{Software Validation Plan}
	
	\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you 
	should
		point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should 
		state that
		here.}
	
	\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check 
	that
		the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task 
		based
		inspection?}
	
	\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}
	
	In order to validate Utrition's implementation, interviews will be scheduled with potential users. In these interviews, the interview conductor will walk through the functional requirements of the system with the interviewee. The interviewee will be asked for their feedback on the current requirements of the system. This feedback may include adding or removing specific functionality (i.e. altering requirements). Software validation will be led by Yasmine Jolly. 
	
	\section{System Test Description}
	
	\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
	The below areas cover all the nine functional requirements outlined in the SRS, dividing the functional requirements into three distinct sections. The first section details user actions associated with image upload and encompasses FR1 and FR2. The second section details image processing done by the system which encompasses FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, and FR7. Lastly, the third section outlines the user steps to view nutritional data which correlates to groupings of functional requirements.
	
	\subsubsection{Image Upload}
	This section has three tests, with each corresponding to an action the user 
	can take with Utrition, corresponding to FR1 and FR2 in the SRS. 
	Testing that users can successfully submit one or multiple images is 
	important to the core functionality of the other components of the 
	application.
	
	\paragraph{Single image upload}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item{one-upload-1\\}
		
		Control: Functional, Dynamic, and Manual.
		
		Initial State: No image in the system.
		
		Input: An image file.
		
		Output: The system accepts the image upload.
		
		Test Case Derivation: The system should accept an uploaded image file from the user.
		
		How test will be performed: A locally stored image will be uploaded to 
		the application through the image upload prompt.
		
		\item{one-upload-2\\}
		
		Control: Functional, Dynamic, and Manual.
		
		Initial State: No image in the system.
		
		Input: A file of extension .txt will be uploaded into the system.
		
		Output: The system will not contain the uploaded file. An error message 
		will be returned.
		
		Test Case Derivation: The system should only save the inputted image if 
		it is of the proper file extension.
		
		How test will be performed: A file of type .txt will be saved on the 
		tester's device. The tester will upload this file to the system.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\paragraph{Multi-image upload}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item{multi-upload-1\\}
		
		Control: Functional, Dynamic, and Manual.

		Test Case Derivation: The system should accept multiple uploaded image files from the user at the same time.
		
		How test will be performed: Three locally stored images will be uploaded to the application through image upload prompts. 
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Image Processing}
	This section contains tests that relate to the processing of an image 
	uploaded by the user. Tests correspond to actions that will be taken by the 
	application during image processing. Relevant functional requirements 
	include FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, and FR7.
	
	\paragraph{Image Identification}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item{image-identification-1\\}

		image, and return the name of the food item as a string.
		
		How test will be performed: The system identified item will be verified 
		that it matches the true item contained in the image.
		
		\item{image-identification-2\\}
		
		Control: Functional and Automatic.
		
		Initial State: System contains an image of extension .jpg type.
		
		Input: System is prompted to process the image.
		
		Output: The type of food that is captured in the image is returned as a 
		string.
		
		Test Case Derivation: The system should identify the food present in an

		that it matches the true item contained in the image.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\paragraph{Call and Fetch API Response}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item{api-1\\}
		
		Control: Functional and Automatic.
		
		Initial State: System on standby.
		
		Input: Food item name as a string.
		
		Output: JSON containing nutrition facts for the inputted food item.
		
		Test Case Derivation: A request will be made to the Nutritionix API 
		with the food item name, which will return a response body containing 
		the food item's nutrition facts.
		
		How test will be performed: The API response will be verified that the 
		contents are as expected.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\paragraph{Logging Data}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item{log-data-1\\}
		
		Control: Functional and Automatic.
		
		Initial State: System contains nutritional data of a food item.
		
		Input: Request to log the data to the database.
		
		Output: Database is updated as the system writes the data to the 
		database.
		
		Test Case Derivation: Nutritional data of a food will be saved for 
		future reference. This is done by logging the data to the database.
		
		How test will be performed: After the system receives the request to 
		update the database, the database will be verified that it is updated 
		with the new data.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\paragraph{Reading Data}

		fetch the data of a food item, the returned data will be verified that 
		it matches with the saved data in the database.
		
		\item{read-data-2\\}
		
		Control: Functional and Automatic
		
		Initial State: Database contains nutritional data of 5 different dates.
		
		Input: Request to fetch the data from the last 3 most recent dates.
		
		Output: A list of the nutritional data from the last 3 most recent 
		dates.
		
		Test Case Derivation: The system shall be able to fetch previously 
		recorded data. The system shall be able to fetch data from a range of 
		dates.
		
		How test will be performed: The nutritional data from the 3 most recent 
		dates will be verified if it matches the data in the database.
		
		\item{read-data-3\\}
		
		Control: Functional and Automatic
		
		Initial State: Database contains nutritional data.
		
		Input: Request to fetch the data of a particular food item that is not 
		logged in the database.
		
		Output: No data is returned.
		
		Test Case Derivation: The system shall be able to fetch previously 
		recorded data. This is an edge case for if the system is requested to 
		read data from the database that does not exist. In this case, no data 
		will be returned.
		
		How test will be performed: The output will be verified to be empty.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsubsection{Nutritional Facts Display}
	This section has three tests, with each corresponding to an action the user can take with Utrition. Each test corresponds to (FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR8), (FR7, FR8), and (FR7, FR8, FR9) respectively in the SRS. These tests will test the actions the user can take after uploading an image, which are comprised of viewing past and present nutritional data in textual and graphical formats.
	
	
	
	\paragraph{Viewing the nutritional data of an uploaded food image}
	
	\begin{enumerate}

		Control: Functional, Dynamic, and Automatic
		
		Initial State: Image(s) exists in system
		
		Input: Input signal from the image upload process
		
		Output: The nutritional data of the food
		
		Test Case Derivation: Primary black-box test for our system as a whole. The system will take the uploaded image(s), analyse them for the food they display, cross-reference them with a nutrition database, and display the information to the user.
		
		How test will be performed: The program will automatically test that the resulting nutrition data of a pre-uploaded image file matches that of the nutrition database entry for the food.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\paragraph{Viewing textual nutritional data of logged foods}
	
	\begin{enumerate}

		The developer will go into each module found in the utrition/src directory, and will inspect the code to ensure that each rule outlined in Canada’s or Google’s guide is strictly adhered to.
		
		\item{NFR29}
		
		Type: Functional, Dynamic, and Manual.
		
		Initial State: A Durum Wheat Semolina developer has completed a module for Utrition, and has Pylint installed on their device.
		
		Input/Condition: The developer runs Pylint on their code.
		
		Output/Result: Pylint will notify the developer if there needs to be changes to the code to ensure Utrition adheres to the PEP8 Python coding conventions.
		
		How test will be performed: The developer will open their command prompt and travel to the directory with the finished code (utrition/src) by using “cd”. The developer runs Pylint on the finished code by typing “pylint finishedmodule.py” in their command prompt. The name “finishedmodule.py” is a placeholder for any future modules that Utrition will implement in the future. The command prompt will notify the developer to make any necessary changes.

	\subsection*{Skills}
	
	\subsubsection*{Usage of Pytest framework}
	Utrition's testing process will include unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests as a part of the verification and validation process. Pytest is a framework that is used for writing simple and scalable test cases for databases, APIs, and user interfaces. This framework can be used for anything from simple unit tests to complex functional tests. To master the use of Pytest, a team member can study the Pytest documentation, reference guides, and refer to the Pytest support community posts when necessary. Following tutorials and how-to guides can also prove to be helpful when learning how to use this framework.  
	
	\subsubsection*{CI/CD with automatic test cases in GitHub}
	
	During the development phase, new code should be continuously tested in 
	order to mitigate the introduction of bugs. GitHub Actions is an effective 
	tool that can be leveraged in order to automate testing every time new 
	code is added to the repository. By automating test cases, unit tests can 
	be executed whenever new pull requests are open to ensure new additions 
	have not broken any existing functionality. To implement this, team members 
	can consult online articles on the use of these CI/CD tools, or watch a 
	video walk-through on how to add automated testing to an existing GitHub 
	project.
	
	\subsubsection*{Usage of Jest framework} 
	Developers of Durum Wheat Semolina must be able to test the frontend development of Utrition which is made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Jest is a testing framework that can write tests specifically for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that can be run from the command line The team has decided to use this framework to ensure the correctness and usability of the code for Utrition. This tool will be able to automatically catch errors in the code so that developers do not need to manually go over the code themselves. To master using the Jest framework, team members can watch online tutorials or read Jest supporting documentation.
	
	\subsubsection*{Knowledge of and performing effective static code inspections}
	This skill describes the ability to understand the necessary components for a static code inspection and be able to perform one effectively. These inspections are done for all new code attempting to merge into the main branch of the team's GitHub through a PR. When static code inspections are not done properly, sloppy code will enter the main project which can cause errors as implementation progresses. Some approaches for learning what should be included in a code inspection and how to perform said inspection is by reading documentation on what should be done during a code inspection and asking more experienced team members of Utrition for guidance.
	
	\subsubsection*{Installing and using Pylint}
	When coding in Python, we do not have a visible compiler to catch syntax errors and bugs prior to running our program as we might have in Java or Haskell. Pylint is required for catching errors like this, as well as for ensuring consistent and syntactically correct code that follows established coding practices. Pylint can be installed through a \textbf{pip install pylint} command in the terminal, and can be used through the command \textbf{pylint filename.py} to evaluate a file. Pylint can be set up to ignore or only use certain coding rules in its extensive coding practice ruleset, making it customizable to our own specific uses. This skill can be developed by reading the documentation of Pylint and its syntax rules to see which ones are relevant to Utrition. Practicing coding with Pylint can also help acclimatize a team member and help develop good habits for using Pylint before pushing changes.
	
	\subsubsection*{Knowledge of Google Style Guides for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS}
	Frontend developers of Durum Wheat Semolina need to understand and implement the Google style guides for frontend technologies in order for all Utrition code to be consistent. By following these style guides, developers do not need to take extra time attempting to decipher unorganized code. Once the developers understand the Google style guides, they will be able to do static code reviews of the written modules. Therefore, they will now be equipped to complete the NFR28 test for the validation and verification of the project. One method for learning the style guides is by approaching the task like a school test. The person learning should take notes on the guide, and to quiz themselves at random intervals. Another way of acquiring the knowledge of the style guides is to use online video resources to help teach them the material.
	
	\subsection*{Teammate Specific Learning Approaches}
	\subsubsection*{Alexander Moica}
	Alexander would like to write code with greater consistency in its syntax and that follows established coding standards, even those he does not know about. To help him develop these skills and habits, he will incorporate Pylint into his existing projects and create personal coding projects that make use of Pylint from the very start. Alexander will learn to master using Pylint through practice since he learns fastest by making mistakes and remembering them in the future.
	
	\subsubsection*{Yasmine Jolly}
	Yasmine has had no previous experience working with the Jest testing framework and requires this knowledge for the testing of Utrition. She will be watching video tutorials on how to use and write effective test cases in Jest. This method of learning was chosen because Yasmine finds it effective to learn by watching examples. With videos, she can pause and rewind steps that she did not fully understand.
	
	\subsubsection*{Jeffrey Wang}
	
	Jeffrey has sparsely worked with automated testing frameworks during his 
	previous work experience, and seen the ways it has helped to prevent the 
	introduction of bugs. As a result, he is interested in leveraging CI/CD 
	tools to automate test cases, and set up mitigations to prevent the 
	introduction of bugs during the development of Utrition. In order to 
	complete this successfully, Jeffrey plans to read online tutorials about 
	the potential ways to automate test cases using GitHub Actions. He has chosen this strategy because the tutorials will walk him through the process step-by-step which he finds most effective for learning.
	
	\subsubsection*{Jack Theriault}
	Jack has chosen to develop his knowledge in the Google style guides. Jack has made this choice because he has never used any frontend coding technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. Since he is using these languages for the first time, it is best that he develops proper coding style while working in the new languages. To become familiar with the style guides, Jack will read through the guides and quiz himself at regular intervals. He has chosen this learning strategy because he usually learns this way during school and has found it effective.
	
	\subsubsection*{Catherine Chen}
	
	Catherine has had limited experience when writing Python tests using Pytest. She'd like to develop her scalable test writing skills, which include unit tests and functional tests. Her goal is to become familiar with the Pytest framework in order to achieve her goals. Catherine has chosen to read Pytest documentation to learn this skill because of how easily she can access supporting documentation is online.
	
	\subsubsection*{Justina Srebrnjak}
	Justina has identified that she struggles with performing static code inspections on other team members' code. More specifically, she is confused about what should be inspected during these reviews (ex. code functionality, potential errors, coding conventions). To master this skill, Justina will seek guidance from fellow teammates who have performed many code inspections in the past (from co-op experiences). To learn most effectively, she will watch one of her teammates perform a static code inspection of another team member's work. She has chosen this strategy because she finds it helpful to watch an example be completed where she can take notes on important steps in the process. With these notes, she will replicate and refer to them when she performs her own reviews.
