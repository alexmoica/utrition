\section{Goals}

This section contains the project goals integral to the development of 
Utrition. These goals outline the primary reasons for the product's existence, 
and are critical in contributing to its completeness.

\subsection{Collection of Images}

Utrition outputs the nutritional properties of food found in pictures 
provided by the user. Users will be allowed to upload pictures to the system, 
where they will be saved for further processing and analysis. This features 
serves as the core user input interaction that users will experience when they 
want to log their diet.

\subsection{Accurate Food Detection}

Utrition will use computer vision to identify the food items present in 
user-provided images. These food recognition services will analyze pictures, 
and highlight individual food objects found in the image. The set of identified 
foods are listed and recorded, and will be used for further processing. This 
feature leverages food recognition technology to streamline the process of 
logging one's diet. Instead of having the user list a breakdown of their meal, 
Utrition will determine what the user is eating from the provided image.

\subsection{Communication of Nutritional Information}

\subsection{Record User's Consumed Nutrients}

\subsection{Access Previous Meal Data}

\section{Stretch Goals}

This section contains project goals that are not integral to the development of Utrition, but would be valuable extensions to develop once the aforementioned goals are met.

\subsection{Web Hosting}

Users will be able to access the Utrition application online through a website hosted on the internet. This will increase the user base of Utrition by making Utrition more accessible and convenient to use. Once hosted online, the delay between passing an input to Utrition and receiving an output will be similar in length to the local implementation of Utrition within a small margin of error.

\subsection{Logging Preset Meals}

Users will be able to create presets of their commonly eaten meals on Utrition 
and save them for future use. Once a preset is created, a user will be able to 
select it to log the information of the meal without needing to manually 
re-upload images. This feature will allow users to customize Utrition to fit 
their eating habits, while also reducing the amount of time it takes to log a 
meal and access its information.

\subsection{Identifying Complex Food Items}

One stretch goal our team has is to improve upon the product's food identification implementation. Once our system is able to identify basic food items consisting of one part (ex. apple, cheese, chicken), the next step would be for Utrition to identify increasingly complex items and its individual parts (ex. hamburger with bun, beef, tomoato, lettuce, and cheese). This feature allows the user to simply input one image of their meal instead of uploading pictures of its individual parts. The result is a significant reduction in time needed for the user to determine their nutrition facts for their meal, increasing the efficiency and usability of the system.

\subsection{Providing Insights into User's Eating Habits}

Another stretch goal for Utrition is being able to provide insights into the eating habits of the user. For example, some insights the system might give include informing the user that their calorie count is too low or that they are deficient in fibre. With this additional functionality, the application becomes more informative and useful for users. Instead of simply tracking their food intake, users will now receive suggestions to improve their eating habits.
