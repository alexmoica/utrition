\section{Team Meeting Plan}

Team meetings will occur twice every week. These meetings will take place from 6:30-7:30 on Mondays and from 1:30-2:30 on Thursdays. The location for the meetings will be on the McMaster University campus, in a private study room that will be booked and notified to all group members 24 hours before the meeting. Catherine Chen is responsible for booking the meeting room. Any additional meetings will be planned in accordance with all members availablity when needed.

All six groups members are expected to attend every meeting. In the event that a group member plans to miss a meeting, they must notify all groups members beforehand and continue to complete their assigned work.

Meetings will follow the meeting agenda created by Yasmine Jolly. Any member can add to the agenda which can be found in a word document inside the team's Microsoft Teams channel. Yasmine will chair all meetings, ensuring all agenda items are discussed in order of highest priority.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

The team will communicate primarily through Facebook Messenger chat. All members have the application downloaded on their phones and will receive notifications when a new message is sent. This ensures replies will be sent in a timely fashion. In emergency cases where a member must get in contact with another member as soon as possible, they may call them on their personal cell phone number. Personal contact information has been shared between all members.
