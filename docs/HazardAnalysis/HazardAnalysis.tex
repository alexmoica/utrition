\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system boundaries for this hazard analysis will include the device that the application is installed on as well as the components of the application itself. These components consist of image upload, image pre-processing, image processing \& identification, API request calling, data logging, data log access, and data display components.

\subsection{Image Upload}
This component allows an image to be uploaded and relayed to the pre-processing component.

\subsection{Image Pre-Processing}
This component takes an uploaded image and applies the algorithms needed to convert the raw image data into a format that can be used by a machine learning image model.

\subsection{Image Processing \& Identification}
This component is where the machine learning model analyzes the pre-processed image to identify the food displayed by comparing it to the images it was exposed to during its supervised learning. 

\subsection{API Request Calling}
This component allows the application to interface with the Nutritionix API to access nutritional data on a given food.  

\subsection{Data Logging}
This component logs past uses of the application by the identified food and the date it was used.   

\subsection{Data Log Access}
This component returns the recorded logs of past uses of the application.

\subsection{Data Display}
This component displays data visually for the user to see, either in textual or graphical formats.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You 
should
	minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For 
	instance,
	you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to 
	include
	this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
\subsection{Safety Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}1.]
	\item Utrition will be able to detect when the user uploads an abnormal 
	image format, too many images, or images that are too large. A prompt will 
	be given to the user, instructing them of their error. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Utrition should not crash by improper user 
	input. Users should have an opportunity to amend a their faulty input in 
	order to use the services provided by the application.\\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H1-1, H1-2, H1-3.
	
	\item Utrition will abort retrieval of nutritional information if it cannot 
	be completed successfully. The user will be notified when such 
	an error occurs. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Information retrieval may fail due to a variety of 
	reasons, and the user should be notified of the reason why the service 
	could not be completed as expected.\\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H2-1, H2-2, H3-1, H3-2, H3-3, H4-1, H5-1. H5-2.
	
	\item Utrition will prompt the user if food identification cannot 
	be completed successfully. The user will be notified on the type of error 
	that occurs. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Food identification may fail due to a variety of 
	reasons, and the user should be notified so they may attempt to find a  
	workaround for the issue. \\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H5-1. H5-2.
	
	\item Utrition will prompt the user if past nutritional trends cannot
	be displayed successfully. The user will be notified on the type of error 
	that occurs. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Failure to display past nutritional trends may fail 
	due to a variety of reasons. The user should be be made aware of the issue, 
	and the underlying cause behind it.\\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H6-1.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}1.] 
	\setcounter{enumi}{4}
	
	\item Utrition will store the user’s data locally. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:} Only the user should have to view their stored dietary 
	habits. \\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H4-2.
	
	\item Utrition will periodically save user’s data during use. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:} In the event of unexpected shutdown, the user should 
	not lose all information from the last session. Periodically saving user 
	information will allow users to continue from their last step in the event 
	of an unexpected shutdown. \\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H4-2.
\end{enumerate}
