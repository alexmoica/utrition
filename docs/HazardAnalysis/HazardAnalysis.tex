\section{Introduction}

This document discusses the hazards associated with Utrition. In the context 
of Utrition, hazards are defined to be a set of circumstances that prevent 
the expected use of the system, leading to an error state. The document will 
communicate the scope, boundaries and assumptions made when completing the 
hazard analysis, and provide a list of identified hazards. In addition, it will 
mention recommended actions to mitigate and circumvent hazards encountered 
while using the system.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The purpose of conducting a hazard analysis is to document the system conditions, that along with conditions in the environment, can cause harm or damage. Documentation for how to control or mitigate these conditions will also be included. The scope of this hazard analysis will span from the time the user inputs a food item into Utrition to the time when the nutritional data results of their input are displayed, including the pre-processing, processing, API request, and data representation steps.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system boundaries for this hazard analysis will include the device that the application is installed on as well as the components of the application itself. These components consist of text upload, voice upload, voice-to-text translation, image upload, image pre-processing, image processing \& identification, API request calling, data logging, data log access, user settings saving, user settings access, data calculations, and data display components.

\subsection{Text Upload}
This component allows an textual input to be uploaded by the user and relayed to the API request calling component.

\subsection{Voice Upload}
This component allows an audio recording to be uploaded by the user and relayed to the voice-to-text translation component.

\subsection{Voice-to-Text Translation}
This component an audio recording and converts it to text. This text is relayed to the API request calling component.

\subsection{Image Upload}
This component allows an image to be uploaded by the user and relayed to the pre-processing component.

\subsection{Image Pre-Processing}
This component takes an uploaded image and applies the algorithms needed to convert the raw image data into a format that can be used by a machine learning image model.

\subsection{Image Processing \& Identification}
This component is where the machine learning model analyzes the pre-processed image to identify the food displayed by comparing it to the images it was exposed to during its supervised learning. 

\subsection{API Request Calling}
This component allows the application to interface with the Nutritionix API to access nutritional data on a given food.  

\subsection{Data Logging}
This component logs past uses of the application by the identified food and the date it was consumed.   

\subsection{Data Log Access}
This component returns the recorded logs of past uses of the application. These logs include past food items consumed by the user.

\subsection{User Settings Saving}
This component will save user settings that are relevant for BMI and recommended calories calculations.

\subsection{User Settings Access}
This component returns the saved user settings which can be used in required calculations.

\subsection{Data Calculations}
This component calculates all the required values needed when displaying the user's data. This includes calories consumed per day, BMI, and recommended calories. 

\subsection{Data Display}
This component displays data visually for the user to see, either in textual or graphical formats.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You 
should
	minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For 
	instance,
	you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to 
	include
	this potential failure mode.}

In this Hazard Analysis, two assumptions are made. Firstly, the user will not be intentionally trying to cause errors in Utrition. Secondly, the user is assumed to have sufficient storage space to download and run the application.

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H4-2.
	
	\item Utrition will return an error message when the user uploads more than three images at once. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Utrition should not crash by improper user 
	input. Users should have an opportunity to upload three or fewer images to the system.\\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H4-3.
	
	\item Utrition will prompt the user if food identification cannot 
	be completed successfully. The user will be notified on the type of error 
	that occurs. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Food identification may fail due to a variety of 
	reasons, and the user should be notified so they may attempt to find a  
	workaround for the issue. \\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H5-1. H5-2.
	
	\item Utrition will return an error message if the request to retrieve 
	nutritional information cannot be completed successfully. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Information retrieval requests may fail due to a 
	variety of reasons, and the user should be notified of the reason why the 
	service could not be completed as expected.\\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H6-1.
	
	\item Utrition will return an error message if the nutritional information 
	of a specific item cannot be found.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  The user should be notified if the nutritional data of 
	their food item cannot be fetched.\\
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H6-2.
	
	\item Utrition will return an error message if the user's past nutritional 
	logs cannot be found.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  The user should be notified if their nutritional data 
	of past meals cannot be found.\\
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H7-1.
	
	\item Utrition will return an error message if the user's past nutritional 
	logs have been deleted.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  The user should be notified if their nutritional data 
	of past meals are no longer saved in the system.\\
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H7-2.

	\item Utrition will return NULL values if the user's settings cannot be found.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  The user should be notified if their settings cannot be found.\\
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H8-1.
	
	\item Utrition will not display data calculations if there is no past food item inputs or user settings.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  The user will see that there is no data to do calculations for.\\
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H9-1.
	
	\item Utrition will prompt the user if past nutritional trends cannot
	be displayed successfully. The user will be notified on the type of error 
	that occurs. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Failure to display past nutritional trends may fail 
	due to a variety of reasons. The user should be made aware of the issue, 
	and the underlying cause behind it.\\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H10-1.
	
	\item Utrition will not display data if there is no past food item inputs or user settings.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  The user will see that there is no data to be displayed.\\

	connect to the system so they may apply a fix to the issue. \\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H11-1.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}1.] 
	\setcounter{enumi}{16}
	
	\item Utrition will periodically save user’s data during use. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:} In the event of unexpected shutdown, the user should 
	not lose all information from the last session. Periodically saving user 
	information will allow users to continue from their last step in the event 
	of an unexpected shutdown. \\	
	\textbf{Associated Hazards:} H11-2.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone 
timeline?
	Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

Durum Wheat Semolina is planning to implement SR1-SR17 during Utrition's capstone timeline. All requirements are easy to implement and do not provide much strain to the system. They exist to guide the user through Utrition, and to aid Utrition in being an easy-to-understand application.
