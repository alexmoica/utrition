		Expected Results: The variable "lines" will will be of length 2. The value at the second index of the list will equal the sample data when converted from a list format to a JSON object format. 
		
		How The Test Was Performed: The sample data is sent to our CSV logger function to create an entry for the data as well as its header row detailing the keys of the key value JSON pairings. To account for this header row, after we read the CSV file line by line with the built-in Python function readlines(), we check that the length of the returning list is 2.
		
		Actual Results: The actual results matched up with the expected results.
        \item{Test Name: past-nutrition-text-read-data-2}
		
		Initial State: The system contains a list of four distinct object of sample JSON data.
		
		Input: The sample data is logged to a CSV file and then the read\_file() function is called with its result saved to the variable "result".
		
		Expected Results: The variable "result" will will be of length 4.
		
		How The Test Was Performed: The sample data is sent to our CSV logger function to create entries for each data as well as an overall header row detailing the keys of the key value JSON pairings. Our read\_file() function then reads the CSV file, ignoring the header row, and returns a sorted list of data objects. Since the header row is ignored, we can check that the length of the list of data returned is exactly equal to the number of data points we had in our sample data.
		
		Actual Results: The actual results matched up with the expected results.

        \item{Test Name: read-data-3}
		
		Test was removed from Revision 0. Utrition no longer retrieves CSV data by querying for a specific food, making testing for a request for an un-logged food unnecessary.

        \item{Test Name: past-nutrition-graph}
		
		Test was removed from Revision 0. Utrition no longer supports displaying graphs of logged food.

	\end{enumerate}

	Apart from the more defined tests discussed above, additional usability testing was conducted on several participants to obtain feedback regarding Utrition's overall quality and user experience. A semi-structured interview was conducted on a total of 5 individuals of different genders and ethnicities to provide a wide range of opinions and suggestions. The interview process consisted of a brief explanation of the application, sample tasks for the participant to perform, and a series of questions. The raw notes from each interview can be found in Appendix A.
	
	Many useful insights were gathered from the interview results. When participants were asked to input mulitple food entries, most opted for text or voice upload options. The majority of participants did not read the instructions, but completed the task quickly and with ease. Common likes brought up by participants included the colour scheme and layout of the application, the ease of use regarding food entry upload, and the depth of information found on the profile page.
	
	In terms of common dislikes, many participants wanted to see units beside the nutritional data they were receiving, more error messages when something goes wrong, and to have meals grouped together based on input time when viewing the profile page. Additional features that individuals wish to see in feature revisions include BMI inputs from the user, goal setting, and a graph displaying past food input information. Greater explanation on implementation changes are discussed in section 7.

		Output/Result: The user will be able to access every page of the user interface in 2 seconds or less.
		
		How test will be performed: A developer on Durum Wheat Semolina will measure the time it takes for each new screen to load using a stopwatch. The developer will open Utrition on their personal device. The developer will upload an image of different food items 10 times, with a minimum 1 minute time difference between the inputs. The uploaded images of the food items will be randomly selected by the developer in the utrition/test/testPhotos directory. The developer will navigate to each screen, timing each transition.
		
		\textbf{Results}: Test passed, output matched the expected result. The testing developer reported that the navigation and loading time for every page took less than 1 second.
		
		\item{PT-2} 
		
		Type: Functional, Dynamic, and Manual.
		
		Initial State: The user loads into Utrition.
		
		Input/Condition: The user uploads 3 images simultaneously.
		
		Output/Result: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The user is able to view the identification for all 3 food items in 10 or less seconds.
			\item The user is able to view the nutritional information for all 3 food items in 5 or less seconds.
		\end{itemize}
		
		How test will be performed: A developer on Durum Wheat Semolina will 
		open Utrition. The developer 
		will upload three images of food found in the utrition/test/testPhotos 
		directory. The developer clicks to view 
		the foods’ nutritional information. The developer measures the amount 
		of time it takes for Utrition to notify the user of the name of the 
		identified food items. The developer measures the amount of time it 
		takes for the system to change from the food identification interface 
		to the nutritional information interface.
		
		\textbf{Results}: Test failed. The developer reported that multiple images were not able to be uploaded simultaneously, and had to be uploaded consecutively. After uploading an image, the developer reported that it took less than 5 seconds for the food to be identified and for the food's nutritional data to be displayed.
		
		\item{PT-3}

	\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
	
	The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members 
	on the
	graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan 
		different
		from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
		differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why 
		did
		these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in 
		future
		projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to 
		clearly
		predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build 
		the
		evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that 
		most
		teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
	\end{enumerate}
	There have been multiple changes from the initial production of the verification and validation plan to the final results of the verification and validation report. Most of the changes were due to either changes in requirements or infeasibility of tests.  After our POC demonstration multiple changes were made to the utrition application and additional functional requirements were added. Due to this, we did not have tests planned for these new requirements as they had not been created at the time. Similarly, some tests that were previously created were taken out of the documentation as to conduct the test either the time or resources needed were too demanding given the time period. These changes of the test plan due to requirements being added would not have been discovered without the POC demonstration. Functionality like the voice upload feature was not previously accounted for and therefore tests were made to provide quality assurance of our new feature. Going forward we know to anticipate changes when user testing or demonstrations are conducted.
