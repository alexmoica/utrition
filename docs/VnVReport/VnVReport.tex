	\subsection{Usability}
	Apart from the more defined tests discussed above, additional usability testing was conducted on several participants to obtain feedback regarding Utrition's overall quality and user experience. A semi-structured interview was conducted on a total of 5 individuals of different genders and ethnicities to provide a wide range of opinions and suggestions. The interview process consisted of a brief explanation of the application, sample tasks for the participant to perform, and a series of questions. The raw notes from each interview can be found in Appendix A.
	
	Many useful insights were gathered from the interview results. When participants were asked to input mulitple food entries, most opted for text or voice upload options. The majority of participants did not read the instructions, but completed the task quickly and with ease. Common likes brought up by participants included the colour scheme and layout of the application, the ease of use regarding food entry upload, and the depth of information found on the profile page.
	
	In terms of common dislikes, many participants wanted to see units beside the nutritional data they were receiving, more error messages when something goes wrong, and to have meals grouped together based on input time when viewing the profile page. Additional features that individuals wish to see in feature revisions include BMI inputs from the user, goal setting, and a graph displaying past food input information. Greater explanation on implementation changes are discussed in section 7.

	\section{Changes Due to Testing}
	
	Due to the feedback collected during usability testing, Utrition's implementation will undergo changes to provide the best user experience possible. Taking into consideration the time constraints and the most commonly discussed improvements, these changes will be implemented:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Add "Get Started" button to home page to take user to input a food item
		\item Add units to nutritional data output
		\item Create error messages for cases where inputted food item is not identifiable 
		\item Group entries in food history table based on entries submitted together
		\item Fix "reset" button in voice upload functionality to remain on current page
		\item Add graph to display past food entry data
		\item Optional height and weight user inputs to calculate BMI and recommended calories per day

	\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
	
	The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members 
	on the
	graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan 
		different
		from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
		differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why 
		did
		these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in 
		future
		projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to 
		clearly
		predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build 
		the
		evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that 
		most
		teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
	\end{enumerate}
