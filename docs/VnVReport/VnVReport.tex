	\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
	
	The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members 
	on the
	graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan 
		different
		from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
		differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why 
		did
		these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in 
		future
		projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to 
		clearly
		predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build 
		the
		evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that 
		most
		teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
