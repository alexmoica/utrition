Date of project start:

This project is an open source project that allows users to track their progress towards their health goals. Users can upload a picture, speak, or type out what they ate in natural language, and Utrition provides all the nutritional data of the meal and saves it in the user's profile. The profile contains data visualizations and metrics to assist users in tracking their nutrition goals.
